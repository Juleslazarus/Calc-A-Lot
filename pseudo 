make an event listener that sends the var value which is the eventlistiner 
innerText of the button to the screen for all the operators 

make an event listener that works like this: 

operator.addEventListener('click', () => {
    <!-- when either one of the operators ('/', '+', '-', '*') is clicked 
    it can send the inputValue into the screenValue like so:  -->
    screenValue = `${inputValue}` + operator.innerText; 

    which whould take the input value and add it to the screen 
    innerText value with the operator comming after it. 

    then we can make the equals button work like so 

    if (operator === '=') {
        if (screenValue.innerText.includes('/')){
            let screenValue.innerText = screenValue.innerText / inputValue.innerText; 
            or we can have a resultScreen just in case theres issues with 
            this like so: 

            resultScreen.innerText = screenValue.innerText / inputValue.innerText; 
        }
    }
    
})
